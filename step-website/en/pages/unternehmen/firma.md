The company
-----------

The STEP Sensortechnik and Elektronik Pockau GmbH was founded in 1993. The location, formerly Werk2 of the ROBOTRON Messtechnik Dresden, provided over 35 years tradition and experience with the development and production of nuclear radiation measurement and fire alarm systems. Through the steady development and expansion of its production and service profile, STEP is a reliable partner for innovative products in the national and international market for sensor and measuring technologies.
